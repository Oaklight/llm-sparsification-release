# LLM Sparsification homework 

My report is found in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md)

Most of my work is in [llm-sparsification.ipynb](llm-sparsification.ipynb)

The code in [src](src) was run after the sparsified models were generated in [llm-sparsification.ipynb](llm-sparsification.ipynb). They were run from the directory corresponding to the [huggingface pytorch examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling). I ran this inside of a conda environment in which I built the `transformers` from source and then installed the `requirements.txt` for this set of examples.
